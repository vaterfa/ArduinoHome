After installing this code to our nodeMcu board we can use it from internet.
We don't need being in local network anymore.

We can use relays and servo motor with this code also we will take notifications
from Blynk app when sensor values pass our threshold that we specify.

The differences from the Ver_3 version are, relay pins are now controls with
values of virtual pins and some other changes for Taskes addition.
